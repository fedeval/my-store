## How to use ##

### Installing dependencies ###

After cloning the repo, all the project dependencies can be installed using npm:

```
npm install
```

### Development server ###

```
ng serve
```

will run the app on a dev server listening by default on port `4200`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the app and interact with it. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. If you wish the dev server to listen on a different port run `ng serve --port PORT_NUMBER`

```
ng test
```

to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Formatting ####

The code can be automatically formatted using prettier. The formatting options can be customised by editing the `.prettierrc`file.

#### Linting ####

The code can ba automatically linted using ESlint. Note that ESlint will also use prettier to test for incorrect formatting. Rules, plugins and extensions for ESlint can be modified through the `.eslintrc` file.
